## Evaluation Process for Manufacturing Components

When creating or reviewing manufacturing components, ask:

1. **Does this build trust with manufacturing decision makers?**
2. **Are cost savings and ROI clearly visible and emphasized?**
3. **Does this support manufacturing-specific workflows (ERP, compliance, bulk)?**
4. **Would this work effectively in an industrial environment?**
5. **Does this feel enterprise-grade and suitable for B2B procurement?**
6. **Are freight-specific features (LTL/FTL, freight class) properly supported?**

### Manufacturing Design Prompts for AI
