# Design Rubrics for Shipping Aggregator Components
*Kevin Lenway's A-Grade Design Framework*

## Overall Design Philosophy
Create a professional, trustworthy shipping platform that reduces cognitive load and builds confidence in shipping decisions. Every component should feel reliable, efficient, and enterprise-ready while remaining accessible to SMB users.

- **Hierarchy**: Clear visual hierarchy with 3-4 distinct levels of importance
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design that scales beautifully to desktop
- **Content Density**: Optimal information density - not cramped, not sparse

### B-Grade Layout
- Minor alignment issues or inconsistent spacing
- Some visual hierarchy present but could be clearer
- Responsive but may have minor mobile issues
- Adequate white space but not optimized

### C-Grade Layout
- Inconsistent spacing and alignment
- Weak visual hierarchy
- Poor mobile experience
- Too cramped or too sparse

### Poor Layout
- No consistent spacing or grid system
- Elements randomly placed

## 2. Typography Rubric

### A-Grade Typography
- **Font Hierarchy**: 4-5 distinct font sizes with clear purpose (H1: 32px, H2: 24px, H3: 20px, Body: 16px, Small: 14px)
- **Line Height**: Optimal readability (1.5x for body text, 1.3x for headings)
- **Font Weight**: Strategic use of weight for emphasis (Regular: 400, Medium: 500, Bold: 600)
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1 minimum for normal text)
- **Letter Spacing**: Subtle adjustments for premium feel (-0.025em for headings)
- **Text Alignment**: Left-aligned for readability, center only for short labels

### B-Grade Typography
- Good hierarchy but may have 1-2 inconsistent sizes
- Adequate line height and contrast
- Some strategic use of font weight

- **Error Red**: #dc2626 (Failed deliveries, critical issues)
- **Gray Scale**: 8-level grayscale from #111827 to #f9fafb
- **Semantic Colors**: Consistent color meaning across all components
- **Accessibility**: All color combinations meet WCAG AA standards
- **Brand Consistency**: Colors reinforce shipping/logistics trust

### B-Grade Color System
- Good primary colors but inconsistent application
- Most combinations accessible
- Some semantic meaning established

### C-Grade Color System
- Basic color palette with some accessibility issues
- Inconsistent application across components
- Limited semantic meaning

### Poor Color System
- Random colors with no system
- Poor accessibility
- No brand coherence

- **Atomic Design**: Clear atoms → molecules → organisms → templates
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Composability**: Components work together seamlessly
- **Props Interface**: Clean, typed props with sensible defaults
- **State Management**: Proper state encapsulation and lifting
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering with proper memoization

### B-Grade Component Design
- Good separation of concerns
- Most components are reusable
- Props interface mostly clean

### C-Grade Component Design
- Some reusability but inconsistent patterns
- Props interface needs improvement
- Basic state management

### Poor Component Design
- Monolithic components
- No reusability
- Poor state management

## 5. User Experience & Interaction Rubric

### A-Grade UX
- **Intuitive Flow**: Users achieve goals without training
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens and meaningful loading indicators
- **Error Handling**: Clear, actionable error messages with recovery paths
- **Feedback**: Immediate visual feedback for all interactions
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex features revealed progressively
- **Micro-interactions**: Subtle animations that provide feedback

### B-Grade UX
- Generally intuitive with minor friction points
- Good loading states and error handling
- Basic accessibility support

### C-Grade UX
- Some usability issues requiring user learning
- Basic loading and error states
- Limited accessibility

### Poor UX
- Confusing interactions
- No loading states or error handling
- Inaccessible to users with disabilities

## 6. Data Visualization & Information Design Rubric

### A-Grade Data Design
- **Clarity**: Information hierarchy makes data scannable
- **Relevance**: Only essential data shown, details on demand
- **Comparison**: Easy to compare rates, carriers, and options
- **Visual Encoding**: Appropriate use of charts, tables, and indicators
- **Real-time Updates**: Live data with smooth transitions
- **Export Options**: Data available in multiple formats

### B-Grade Data Design
- Good information hierarchy
- Most relevant data visible
- Some comparison capabilities

### C-Grade Data Design
- Basic data presentation
- Some organization but could be clearer
- Limited comparison features

### Poor Data Design
- Information dump with no hierarchy
- Difficult to find relevant data
- No comparison capabilities

## Evaluation Process

When creating or reviewing components, ask:

1. **Does this achieve A-grade in all 7 rubric categories?**
2. **Would a first-time user understand this immediately?**
3. **Does this build trust and confidence in our shipping platform?**
4. **Is this accessible to users with disabilities?**
5. **Does this work perfectly on mobile devices?**
6. **Would enterprise customers be impressed by this quality?**

Use this rubric to guide AI design iterations with specific feedback like:
- "Make this component A-grade in typography by improving the hierarchy"
- "Focus on UX rubric - the error handling needs to be more helpful"
- "Apply the color system rubric to ensure semantic consistency"
