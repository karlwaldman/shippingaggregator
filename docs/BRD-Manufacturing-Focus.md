## Manufacturing SMB Shipping Aggregator Platform

### Executive Summary

**Vision**: Capture the $300+ billion manufacturing logistics opportunity by building the first freight-first shipping aggregator designed specifically for manufacturing SMBs, addressing their unique needs for LTL/FTL shipping, ERP integration, and B2B compliance.

**Mission**: To democratize manufacturing logistics by providing SMB manufacturers with enterprise-grade freight optimization, deep ERP integration, and compliance automation previously only available to Fortune 500 companies.

### Market Opportunity & Strategic Analysis

#### The $300 Billion Manufacturing Blind Spot
- **Total Addressable Market**: $300+ billion (24.8% of $3.79 trillion global logistics market)
- **Serviceable Market**: Manufacturing SMBs with 10-500 employees
- **Market Gap**: Current aggregators focus on e-commerce parcels, ignoring manufacturing freight
- **Growth Driver**: Freight management market growing 9.29% CAGR to $39.76B by 2033

#### Competitive White Space Analysis
**Current Players' Manufacturing Failures:**
- **Shippo**: 40+ carriers but zero LTL/FTL freight support
- **ShipStation**: E-commerce focused, limited ERP integration
- **EasyPost**: New B2B "Forge" still parcel-only
