## Implementation Architecture

### 5. System Integration Points

#### 5.1 Ruby on Rails Integration
```ruby
# Recommended gem structure
class USPSService
  BASE_URL = Rails.env.production? ? 
    'https://apis.usps.com' : 
    'https://apis-tem.usps.com'
    
  def initialize
    @client_id = Rails.application.credentials.usps[:client_id]
    @client_secret = Rails.application.credentials.usps[:client_secret]
    @access_token = get_access_token
  end
  
  def validate_address(address_params)
    # Implementation
  end
  
  def calculate_rates(shipment_params)
    # Implementation  
  end
  
  def track_package(tracking_number)
    # Implementation
  end
end
```

#### 5.2 Database Schema Requirements
```sql
-- API credentials storage (encrypted)
CREATE TABLE usps_credentials (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  client_id_encrypted TEXT,
  client_secret_encrypted TEXT,
  crid_encrypted TEXT,
  mid_encrypted TEXT,
  access_token_encrypted TEXT,
  token_expires_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Address validation cache
CREATE TABLE address_validations (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  input_address_hash VARCHAR(64) UNIQUE,
  validated_address JSONB,
  confidence_score DECIMAL(3,2),
  validation_date TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Rate calculation cache  
CREATE TABLE shipping_rates (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  route_hash VARCHAR(64),
  package_hash VARCHAR(64), 
  rates JSONB,
  cached_until TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Tracking data
CREATE TABLE package_tracking (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  tracking_number VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
  current_status VARCHAR(100),
  tracking_events JSONB,
  last_updated TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 6. Error Handling & Resilience

#### 6.1 Rate Limiting Strategy
- Implement exponential backoff for rate limit errors
- Queue non-urgent requests for off-peak processing
- Monitor API usage against quotas
- Implement circuit breaker pattern

#### 6.2 Error Response Handling
```ruby
class USPSAPIError < StandardError
  attr_reader :error_code, :error_message, :retry_after
  
  def initialize(response)
    @error_code = response.dig('errors', 0, 'code')
    @error_message = response.dig('errors', 0, 'detail')
    @retry_after = response.headers['Retry-After']
    super(@error_message)
  end
end
```

#### 6.3 Fallback Strategies
- Cached rate tables for critical shipping calculations
- Manual address validation workflows for API failures
- Third-party tracking services as backup
- Graceful degradation of features
